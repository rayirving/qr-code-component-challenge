## My process

First I started by breaking down the reference images into sections.
From the reference image, it seemed like the image and text was all contained on a card; I made a div to represent that card.
The content seemed to be stacked upon eachother, so I made the card a Flexbox.
The format of the card matched the reference image, and so the rest of the code was tweaking margins and text sizes to make it match the reference image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I was able to learn more about flexboxs and the different content justifications while workign on this project. 
I also gained a better understanding of element hierarchy and what can be manipulated in order to achive desired results.

### Continued development

In the future I want to work more with flexboxs, and delve further into other layout options such as grid layouts.
I would also like to experiment more with the responsive layouts and sizes (such as vh, vw and rem).
